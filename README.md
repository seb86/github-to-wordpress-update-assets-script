# GitHub to WordPress.org Plugin Assets Updater Script

## üîî Overview

Sometimes you just want to update the assets for your WordPress plugin either it be the banner, the icon or the screenshots. This allows you to do that.

This script is dummy proof and you do NOT need to configure anything so long as you have setup your GIT and SVN login globally. This is to insure you have write permission. Otherwise you will be asked to login every step of the way a GIT or SVN command runs before it proceeds.

Just run the script and follow the instructions as you go along and your assets will be up in no time.
